# Insanely Simple Buoyancy
Insanely simple water buoyancy physics in Unity

Zero research was used to code this, instead I made it up in my head based on how I thought buoyancy worked.

There is no rotation correction, objects don't actually float, but this slows them down when entering and being in water, you could make things float if you changed some values.

This code would work well for small ponds in simple games.
